# AgritechGuard - B.Tech Thesis Project

AgritechGuard represents an innovative agricultural monitoring solution crafted within the context of a B.Tech Thesis Project. It seamlessly integrates automated and manual irrigation capabilities, harnessing the power of LoRa WAN technology for data transmission, even in remote regions with limited internet access. Additionally, it incorporates computer vision to provide real-time alerts to farmers in the event of trespassers entering the field.

## Key Features

- **Automated and Manual Irrigation**: AgritechGuard offers both automated and manual irrigation capabilities, allowing precise control over watering for agricultural fields.

- **LoRa WAN Technology**: It utilizes LoRa WAN technology for data transmission, making it suitable for remote locations with limited internet connectivity [Even if no internet connection].

- **Solar Energy Harvesting**: The system ensures continuous operation by harvesting solar energy, guaranteeing a sustainable power supply, even during power outages.

- **Enhanced Security**: AgritechGuard incorporates the YOLO v8 model for trespasser detection. It sends immediate notifications to users upon the detection of unauthorized trespassers, enhancing security on the farm.
